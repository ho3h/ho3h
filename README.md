# 👋 Hi, I’m Theo — a marketer who codes

I lead **Customer Advocacy at Neo4j**, where I connect marketing, storytelling, and data to showcase how customers use graph technology to solve real-world problems.

This space is where I experiment — building small tools, APIs, and prototypes that make storytelling scalable and measurable.

### 🧠 What I do
- Build automation and internal apps to scale customer storytelling  
- Create APIs that turn reference data into insight  
- Blend marketing strategy with data architecture and product thinking  

### ⚡ Current projects
- **Customer Reference Agent** — ADK Slack Agent powered by Neo4j GraphDB vector-cypher retrieval + Gemini
- **Blueprint Builder** — a microapp that turns case studies into playbooks
- **Graph100** — interactive index of Neo4j’s top customer stories  

> “Marketers who understand systems think in graphs.”
