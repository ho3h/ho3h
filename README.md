Hi — I’m Theo. I lead Customer Advocacy at **Neo4j**, and I build **graph + AI** systems that are meant to work in the real world (not just in a demo).

---

## What I build
- Practical agentic workflows (where “agentic” means “it actually does something useful”)
- Graph-backed retrieval and reasoning patterns for enterprise use cases
- Tools that turn tribal knowledge into something your team can query, reuse, and trust

---

## Selected projects
- **Forum** — multi-persona simulator to pressure-test messaging and positioning  
- **Account Buster** — account intelligence packages that compress research time from hours to minutes  
- **Customer Reference Bot** — Slack agent for finding relevant customers, proof points, and stories  
- **Case Study Engine** — multi-model “tournament” to generate and select higher-quality drafts  
- **Agent Launchpad** — skills vs knowledge framework for building more reliable agents  

---

## What I’m interested in right now
Graph as the knowledge layer, LLMs as the reasoning layer — and the operational glue required to ship it inside a company.

If you’re building in this space, I’m always up for swapping notes.
